# WindowPane

> A simple, free alternative for displaying your camera feed during screen shares and screen recordings.

## What It Does

WindowPane gives you a small, floating window with your camera feed on your current screen!

This is intended for making screencaps with the "Screen Recording" tool Apple provides.

Or use it for Face Time/Zoom/Teams/Slack/Discord calls where you want to share your screen but still keep your face visible.

### Why I Created It

I wanted something very small and simple without the entire bloat of a full-blown studio like CapCut.

I also wanted a freely floating window I can use in any app that's resizable, customizable, and clean.

It's great for doing business and showing off your code!

### Why I Open-Sourced It

**Why not?** It's a simple utility that took me less than a few hours to vibe-code with Codex and ChatGPT & it works perfectly.

Also, I don't have an Apple Developer subscription right this minute to deploy to the App Store... 

So, I've decided just to share the code on my GitHub for anyone to use this as a portfolio piece.

**Hope you enjoy!**
